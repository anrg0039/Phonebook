# Phonebook
This is an phonebook web app, where users can add, see, update and delete their contact
I have created this project using node.js, jade and mongodb.

# Use
On the mainpage three options are there
1. Add Contact
2. Search 
3. List

By clicking on the first option you can add your contact that will be saved in the mongodb database.
By clicking on the second option you can search any contact by name that is stored in database(Under Process).
By clicking on third option you can list all the contacts that is there in the database.

# To run on a local computer

You need to run the server in your computer using 'npm start' command on Project file, then on any browser you can type 'localhost:3000', You will be able to run the application.

# Deployed on Heroku
